            <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Pranjal Jha, and I'm a passionate and driven college
                student pursuing Electronics & Electrical Engineering at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology. I
                believe that every challenge is an opportunity for growth, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I have a passion for learning and growth from childhood to college, gaining experience in
                diverse subjects and disciplines. My school years laid a strong foundation for academic pursuits,
                instilling a love for knowledge and hard work. Extracurricular activities, leadership, collaboration,
                and time management skills were developed. </p>
            <br>
            <p>College provided a stimulating platform for intellectual exploration and self-discovery, shaping them
                into a well-rounded individual ready to tackle new challenges. Throughout my collage years I got to know
                my interest in Web-development so learning it became my passion and this initial spark ignited my love
                for coding.This portfolio demonstrates their
                commitment to lifelong learning and their desire to contribute meaningfully to the world.</p>
